## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried my best to make it look nice with some CSS animation that make it look way much better. So I learned/remembered how to play with transition and adding classes to different component in the pages. It was nice.

### Continued development

I planned to make a lot more of those project in the future to show myself and other what I can do with web Dev.
